      I'm a person with a voracious hunger for knowledge, being self-taught ðŸ¥‡ has led me to learn things that were not
      really that relevant but I enjoyed the whole learning process;
      <br>
      <br>
      I really like UI(user interface) / UX (user experience) ðŸ“² this area of knowledge allows me to fly ðŸš€ my
      imagination and look for a creative solution to a problem âš™.
      <br>
      <br>
      Besides that, I also enjoy the application development process, being able to develop the business logic, working
      it from the databasesðŸ’¾, to the construction of the entire back-end ðŸ’», then in my favorite part, in which I most
      like to innovate the front-endâœ¨ of the application, I am a faithful believer that in the details is the magicðŸª„
